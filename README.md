# Dragon Game
This is first version of my dragon game. It's not finished yet. This version is boring to play, but I have so many ideas for extending it. It will be long way yet. A player keeps his own dragon. Only on Command Line. It will be changed soon!

"dragon.py" is the main module. It uses "value.py" for loading data from "data.txt"
