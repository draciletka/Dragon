# Dragon Game
This is a first version of my dragon game. It's not finished yet. This version is boring to play. I have so many ideas for extending. It will be long way yet. A player keeps his own dragon. Only on Command Line. It will be changed soon!

drak.py is the main module. It uses hodnoty.py for saving data into data.txt
